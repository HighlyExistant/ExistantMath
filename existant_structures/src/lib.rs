/*
    Unlike other parts of this library which take things from pure
    math, physics and are supposed to be extremely generalized,
    this portion of the library is mainly dedicated to making fast
    algorithms for use in my projects. It's important to note that
    these algorithms aren't necessarily the fastest they can be as
    I'm sure there are plenty of libraries that can do what is
    done here and faster, but nevertheless I love to learn, and
    therefore must write these myself, to understand them better.
